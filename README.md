# MPS rest model access api

This is a modelix model-api ([modelix model-api](https://github.com/modelix/model-api)) implementation that works against a remote MPS instance model without incremental change support.

If you somehow ended up here but don't know what modelix is, have a look at modelix [github repository](https://github.com/modelix/modelix) or at [modelix website](https://modelix.github.io).
